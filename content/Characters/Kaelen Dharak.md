Kaelan is 13, a young member of the Talavari people. He was encountered by the group in a devastated town while hiding, visibly frightened. His arrival sparks curiosity about his culture and heritage. Kaelan is proud of his Talavari roots, known for their resilience and adaptability to harsh landscapes.

He reveals a tragic backstory of losing his family during an attack on the town, leaving him with deep emotional scars and a lingering sense of cowardice for fleeing the chaos. Despite his self-doubt, Kaelan's knowledge of the plains and deserts becomes invaluable to the group’s survival and their mission.

His determination not to live or die a coward, combined with his expertise in navigating difficult terrain, makes him a crucial ally. Kaelan does not know it at first, but he is deeply magically connected to animals and nature.
