Dorian is 14. Years old. 

He hasn’t spoken since he was a small child. A bear attacked in the forest while he was with his siblings. They died. He survived—hiding in silence for days. When they found him, he remembered nothing of the violence. But the silence stayed.

Dorian doesn’t speak. He watches. He listens. He moves with quiet purpose. His strength is greater than it should be. His aim never falters.

The magic has always been there. Subtle. Steady. Woven into his bones long before he understood it. Others saw skill. Luthrandir saw truth.

The Elvosians call it _Shan’dorel_—_Shan_: spirit, presence, inner strength. _Dorel_: grounding, alignment, flow. It’s why his hands never shake. Why his arrows never miss.

Under Sael, he begins to shape what’s always lived inside him. Dorian is not loud. But in silence, he is becoming unshakable.
