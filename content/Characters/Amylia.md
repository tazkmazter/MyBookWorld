Amylia is a thoughtful and curious 14 year old who resides in the village of Willowbrook within the kingdom of Eryndor. She finds peace and introspection by the river, where she feels deeply connected to nature. While she appreciates the comforts of her home, she also yearns for adventure beyond Willowbrook, dreaming of exploring the wider world with her younger sister, Maylene. Amylia sometimes feels constrained by the village's unchanging routines and her growing responsibilities.

As the daughter of Kianna and Stevarin, Amylia possesses features that reflect her Kyotoriki heritage. She has been instructed by Joylindra in the ancient language of Faelythra and its associated gestures, which are fundamental to her magical capabilities. Amylia uniquely perceives the world as "the weave," an intricate and interconnected network of shimmering light, sound, and energy that binds all existence. Her magic enables her to manipulate matter by connecting with and influencing these underlying primordial energies.

Through her abilities, Amylia can indirectly affect objects. For example, she can cause boulders to tumble by shifting the earth and smaller stones that support them, effectively guiding the resulting rockfalls. She has also demonstrated the ability to make a small stone hover, showcasing her capacity to influence physical objects through her connection to the weave.

Amylia is skilled with a sword and can strategically approach combat, though she does not share Maylene's strong passion for it. Furthermore, she experiences premonitions of an impending "horror" and is destined to play a crucial role in confronting it.
