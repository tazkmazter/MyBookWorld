Kianna is the mother of Amylia and Maylene. She came to Willowbrook from across the sea as a young woman. Willowbrook had not been her planned destination and was not the only place she had lived, but it was where she met Stevarin, her husband and the girls' father. Over time, it became her home.

She is one of the Kyotoriki, a people from the island nation of Kyotori. She speaks both the common tongue and Kyotoriyu, and she has always had an adventurous spirit.
