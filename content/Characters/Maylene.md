Maylene is Amylia's sister and the other main protagonist. She is introduced as a skilled swordswoman, training under their village's weapon master, Gallen. Maylene has devoted herself to honing her martial talents from a very young age.

In contrast to her sister's more thoughtful approach, Maylene comes across as bold, brash and much more prone to impulsive action. Where Amylia likes to carefully study an activity first, Maylene would rather learn by diving in. She is determined and unfazed by obstacles, thinking she can master the details later through persistence.

When their village is attacked, Maylene initially stands and fights alongside Gallen in a fierce display of courage. She feels intense anger seeing her people captured and wants to rush in without thinking - though she grudgingly accepts Amylia's advice when her life is endangered.

Overall, Maylene seems to represent the gutsy, fight-first counterpoint to her sister's cautious observation thus far. Her talent with a blade is prodigious thanks to relentless training. She also shares Amylia's grief and desire to rescue their loved ones, fueling her resolution.
