Joylindra is a mystical mentor and guardian figure to the sisters Amylia and Maylene, described as being around 50 years old. She is a captivating figure with **grey-streaked chestnut hair, sparkling, mischievous eyes, and an endless array of stunning dark-hued dresses and robes**.

Living on the outskirts of Willowbrook, her cluttered cottage is filled with strange artifacts, herbs, potions, and mystical texts. Joylindra shares her vast knowledge of magic, languages, history, and folklore with the sisters, teaching them to read and write and exposing them to exotic tongues and wondrous stories. Despite skepticism about magic in their world, she displays subtle magical talents, such as miraculous healing, animal communication, and glimpses into the future. She gifts the sisters the magical [[Aen'thael Vyrshan]], hinting at their Elven origins and a foreseen deeper purpose. Her eccentricity and mysterious abilities become pivotal as ominous events unfold around the sisters.
