Gallen is around sixty years old, tall for his time at 183 centimeters, with a sturdy build shaped by a life of hardship and battle. His deep brown hair has turned mostly gray and is usually tied back. Weathered lines cut across his face, but his sharp blue eyes still hold a spark of youth and precision.

He is quiet, stoic, and watchful. His past is unknown. Some believe he was once a soldier, a commander, or something more. He has never confirmed anything.

After a bandit attack years ago, Gallen took charge of Willowbrook’s defense. He trained the villagers himself. What he cannot explain, he shows. His swordsmanship is flawless. His grasp of tactics and combat speaks of long experience. Everything he teaches is exact and efficient.

He began training the sisters when they were young. Maylene in particular looks up to him. She has never defeated him, and he never holds back. He sees what she might become and pushes her toward it.

When monsters attack Willowbrook, Gallen stands alone. He holds the line and slays many before he is overrun. His final stand is unforgettable. His body may fall, but what he taught and what he stood for will not.
