The Aen'thael Vyrshan are pendants described as "soulbound talismans" in the old speech. Joylindra acquired them from a common jeweler's shop, which she found absurd given their apparent nature. She never wore them herself, explaining that they are meant to be shared only by two individuals bound by the deepest love or blood.

The Etymology of the word is as follows:

"Aen'thael Vyr'shan" 

The word is broken down as: 

"Aen" - soul 

"thael" - bound or linked 

"Vyr" - magic or power 

"shan" - amulet or talisman 

So "Aen'thael Vyr'shan" would literally translate to "soul-bound magic-amulet" in [[Faelythra]]
