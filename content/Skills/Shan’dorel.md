Shan’dorel, often shortened to Shan, is the ancient discipline of inner alignment and strength. Not magic in the usual sense, Shan is the channeling of one’s will, breath, spirit, and presence through the body. It allows the practitioner to root themselves, resist force, and exert strength beyond the limit of flesh and bone. 

It extends into control over breath, balance, and motion—turning effort into economy, and motion into meaning. Over time, it may even become a shield against harm, as the body and spirit learn to move in unity with the world around them. 

Dorian can harness the Shan’dorel. Though Dorian had never studied it, his natural power and skill—especially in archery—were already signs of Shan at work. His body and mind had always carried it. Now, for the first time, he begins to understand what it truly is. 

And for Dorian, it is the beginning of a new kind of strength.
