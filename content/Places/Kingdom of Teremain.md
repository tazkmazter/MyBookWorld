**Kingdom of Teramain – Eryndrial Alliance (Lore Notes)**

- **Royal Marriage**
    
    - **Princess Mira of Eryndor** (younger sister to Queen Thalara) wed **Prince Alin of Teramain** a decade ago.
        
    - No minors—both were adults of marriageable age, avoiding any “child bride” concerns.
        
- **Terms of Loyalty**
    
    1. **Military Aid**
        
        - Teramain supplies up to 200 knights/archers to Eryndor in any declared emergency campaign.
            
    2. **Harbor Access**
        
        - Eryndral vessels may use Teramain’s southern port freely during wartime; peacetime trade runs tariff-free.
            
    3. **Council Exchange**
        
        - One Eryndrial adviser serves in Teramain’s court each year, and one Teramain envoy sits in Aldestar’s council—maintaining steady diplomacy.
            
- **Practical Outcome**
    
    - Teramain remains fully sovereign, ruled in its own right by King Alin and Queen-Consort Mira.
        
    - Their son (heir apparent) splits his upbringing between both courts, gaining loyalty to both realms.
        
    - Eryndor never needs to resort to force so long as those treaty terms are honored.
