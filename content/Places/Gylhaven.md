### **Literal Meaning**

> **Gylhaven** = “Bridged Harbor” or “Joined Refuge”

It commemorates the Eryndrial engineers who not only built the ferry docks but spanned the river with their timber-and-stone bridge—uniting two shores and two peoples under one safe haven.

You can note in your lore:

> “Gylhaven, from Old Eryndrial _gyl_ (‘to join’) and _haven_, is the ‘Bridged Harbor’ the crown built as an olive-branch to its eastern neighbors.”

Feel free to adjust pronunciation or spelling to suit your world, but this gives the name a solid bridge-and-port heritage.
